Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview

### Instructions
The script attached to this repo helps you to implement the following steps:

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



### Using the script and files
Download the data files from the link provided earlier.
